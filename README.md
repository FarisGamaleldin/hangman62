## Project Description
This is a Python-based implementation of the classic Hangman game. The objective is to guess the hidden word, one letter at a time, before running out of lives.

**What I Learned**:
- Using classes and methods in Python.
- Handling user input and validating it.
- Writing loops and conditional statements for game logic.
